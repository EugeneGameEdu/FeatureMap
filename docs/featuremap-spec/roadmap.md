# Roadmap (High-Level)

This is a lightweight roadmap of likely next improvements. It is not a commitment.

## Feature Editing in Web

- Edit feature name/description and clusters from the UI (requires API routes + lock semantics).

## More Parsers

- Python parser (AST-based) and richer framework detection.

## Better Incremental Workflows

- Incremental scan (only changed files)
- Clear “stale features” UX based on composition hashes

## Visualization Improvements

- Dark theme
- Minimap
- Performance work for large maps
